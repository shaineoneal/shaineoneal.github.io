WGU states that D214 The Data Analytics Graduate Capstone allows students to apply the academic and professional abilities developed as a graduate student. This capstone challenges students to integrate skills and knowledge from several program domains into one project.

For my Capstone, I decided to do something a bit more relevant to myself rather than an imaginary business problem. At this point in 2024, my partner and I had decided to move out of our home state of upstate South Carolina to somewhere that we both felt more aligned with our values and goals. 

As relocation decisions are large undertakings that require a lot of research and data gathering, I decided to make my Capstone about analyzing potential relocation cities. In this case, I focused on factors that were personally relevant to us, but the process can be applied more broadly.

At the time of beginning this project, I had no real idea of what using map data would entail, so the route that I took was a little bit of a nightmare. Some of the tools I tried, but did not end up using, include:

- PowerBI which I found to be very limiting in terms of mapping capabilities
- ArcGIS which was very powerful, but is expensive and I would have had to change to using their location data formats
- QGIS which is open source and powerful, but couldn't handle the size of my dataset
- Python which struggled to handle the data

Admittedly, I had a lot more data that was I intended/wanted to use, but due to limitations with location data levels and tool capabilities, I had to scale back my ambitions.

I cannot begin to explain how much I don't reccommend working with map data, especially if it comes from the government. I didn't even know you could classify a location in so many ways.

I ended up doing this exact data cleaning in Tableau Prep, Python, and R over the course of figuring out how to do this, but R was the most concise/readable, so it was used in the final paper.
