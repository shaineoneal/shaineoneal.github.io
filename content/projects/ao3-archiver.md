# AO3 Archiver

A browser extension that allows you to archive works from [Archive of Our Own (AO3)](https://archiveofourown.org/) directly to a Google Sheet. This project was inspired by [AO3 Enhancements](https://github.com/jsmnbom/ao3-enhancements) and [AO3: Kudosed and seen history](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/5835-ao3-kudosed-and-seen-history).

The thought behind all of this was "What if I could, instead of using cache or local storage, just have a Google Sheet that tracks all the works I've read or want to read?" This way, I can access my archive from anywhere and have a more permanent record. I am aware that I am basically using Google Sheets as a backend, but it's free, and I don't have to host it.

## Features

- **Archive Works**: Save details of AO3 works (Title, Author, Tags, Word Count, etc.) to a Google Sheet with a single click.
- **Sync Status**: Automatically checks your Google Sheet to show which works you've already archived or read directly on AO3 browsing pages.
- **Mobile Support**: Designed to work on mobile browsers that support extensions (don't ask which one I'm using).
- **Modern Stack**: Built using [WXT](https://wxt.dev/), React, TypeScript, and Sass.

## Building from Source




<details>

<summary>If you really want to try and build this, I think this version works?</summary>
<div class="detail-container">

### Restrictions

- This extenstion currently only works in Google Chrome on desktop. This was originally designed to work with Kiwi Browser on Android, but Kiwi is no longer actively maintained.
- Work is in progress to get this working for both Edge and Firefox. Microsoft Edge Canary should theoretically work, but there is no documentation on how to close their stupid proprietary popup for extensions. Anyway. The current OAuth method uses `chrome.identity` API, which is only supported in Chromium-based browsers.

### Prerequisites

Before you can build or run this extension, you need:

1. **Node.js** (Latest LTS recommended)
2. **Google Cloud Project**: You need to set up a project in the Google Cloud Console to enable the Google Sheets API and obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials.

### Google Cloud Setup

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project.
3. Enable the **Google Sheets API**.
4. Configure the **OAuth Consent Screen** (External user type is usually fine for personal use, but you may need to add yourself as a test user).
5. Create **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs**:
    - Application type: **Web application** (for development/testing) or **Chrome Extension** (for production).
    - **Authorized redirect URIs**: You will need the redirect URI generated by WXT/Chrome.

## Installation & Development

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shaineoneal/archive-of-our-own-archiver.git
    cd archive-of-our-own-archiver
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
    Create a \.env\ file in the root directory with your Google OAuth credentials:

    ```env
    WXT_API_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
    WXT_API_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
    WXT_API_REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri
    ```

4. **Run in Development Mode**
    This will open a Chrome instance with the extension loaded.

    For Chrome:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. **Build for Production**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    The output will be in the \.output\ directory.

## Usage

1. Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar.
2. Log in with your Google Account.
3. Navigate to Archive of Our Own.
4. You will see new controls next to works in lists, allowing you to add them to your spreadsheet.
